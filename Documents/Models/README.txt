istgame.sty: Drawing Game Trees with TikZ
=========================================

Author: In-Sung Cho

Introduction:

This is a LaTeX package that provides macros based on TikZ to draw a game tree.
The main idea underlying the core macros here is the completion of a whole tree
by using a sequence of simple 'parent-child' tree structures, 
with no longer relations involved 
like the use of grandchildren or great-grandchildren.
With the istgame package, you can draw a game tree
as easily as drawing a game tree with pen and paper.

Dependencies:

The package istgame depends on the packages tikz, xparse, and expl3.
